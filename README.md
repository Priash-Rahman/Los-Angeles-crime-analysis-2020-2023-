### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power query , dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Data normalization : Turned the flat schema dataset to star schema for comprehensive analysis .
- Step 5 : Calculated crime time from time occ column & also determined "Hour group" from crime time column afterwards  .
- Step 6 : Created a "Time group" column where 24 hour divided into 6 hour basis for crime analysis .

         -Time group : SWITCH(
       TRUE(),
       MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24) >= 0 && MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24)<=6, "12:00 AM - 5:59 AM" ,              
       MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24) >= 6 && MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24)<=12, "6:00 AM - 11:59 AM" ,              
       MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24) >= 12 && MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24)<=18, "12:00 PM - 5:59 PM" ,              
       MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24) >= 18 && MOD(HOUR('fcrime data'[Crime Time]),24)<=24, "6:00 PM - 11:59 PM" ) 
        
- Step 7 : Catagorized crime nature into offensive & less offensive crimes   . 
- Step 8 : Catagorized age group into 6 sections . 
- Step 9 : Lead time range created from lead time ( 0-30 days / >30 days ) for gaining insights from lead time.
- Step 10: Date table created in power query & "Crime date occ " of fact table and date of date table was connected for time analysis . 
- Step 11 : Removed unnecessary columns & dealt with null, blank  for better analysis.
- Step 12 : Data prepared for analysis & loaded to power bi .
           
- Step 13 :DAX measures created for comprehensive & robust analysis and to create necessary kpi's .
           
           -Total Crimes(distinct count of crimes) .
           -Crimes reported  ( coutrows of fact table).
           -Crime prev month .
           -Crime %  .
           -% of filtered crime . 
           -Condition F month(Icon based on condition ).
           -Condition F year(Icon based on condition)
           -Lebel month .
           -Lebel year.
          

- Step 14 : As main goal was to focus on time 2 dashboard page created "Time analysis"& "Time details" & the last page focuses more on reporting.
          
          -Crimes by month  , year , crime by time group & crimes by month and weekday presented in time analysis along with dangerous crime hour & map chart . 
          -Time details focuses more on high/low time frame of crimes , where top 10 crimes was presented .
          -detail report focuses on crimes based on crime , premises , weapon along with victim by age group ,  in which user can slice & dice the data based on year , time hour .

- Step 15  : Power point template created for time analsis page .

  #### Step 19 : Answering business acumen .

## Question 1 : Which months are high revenue contributor & which months contributing to revenue decline ? Any influence to drive revenue high or low on precise periods ?

- We can clearly notice constant  revenue growth since february ; 
- where Jun-July-Aug pulling the highest revenue ;
- Similar pattern can also be noticed incase of revenue lost along with total revenue ;
- Avearage daily rate playing a chief role in both of the metrics , high avg daily rate pulling revenue high but at the same time it also playing key role for revenue decline.       

## Question 2 : Which months faces high cancelation(booking) ? Any driving factor  ?

- Cancelation trend going upwards since apr and making a constant impact till october 
- At the other end it clearly observed that avg daily rate has a upward trend till Aug .
- Avg daily rate has a key impact driving canceled booking over time !

 - Thu ,Fri & Sat contributing to 52% of cancelation accross weekdays .
 - Friday being the busiest day has highest booking canceled along with highest avg daily rate & high avg days in waiting.
 
 ## Question 4 : Seasons with high Cancelation rate ? Whats the scenario of avg daily rate accross seasons ?

- Avg daily rate peaks in summer & spring as it is most demanding times for organization.
- At the same time we have high cancelation rate at summer & spring .
- Avg daily rate has a postive correlation with cancelation rate.
## Question 5 : Provide insights into lead time . Cancelation based on lead time & do avg daily rate has a correlation with lead time & also do certain customer has high lead time or low lead time  ?

- Advance booking more than 30 days has high cancelation rate across seasons.
- Lead time has a steady relation with avg daily rate 
- Business travellers & solo travellers(friends&family) has high lead time compare to others customers and consequently have booking ratio of 69% & 74%
- Booking far in advance does increase the probability of cancellation !
